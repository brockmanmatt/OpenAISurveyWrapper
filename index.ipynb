Consider the following post:\\npost: \"27 Pediatricians were just fired from a Dallas medical facility and replaced with mid-levels. We have to do something. This has to stop. The rest is copied from Dr. Falcon’s page.   The trend of having employed physicians just “sign off” on mid level charts without allowing them to ACTUALLY supervise them is pervasive now, with the push for “cheaper” care by many hospitals without concern for patient safety.     They want to use our liability so when something goes wrong, they can blame a person who wasn’t even there and didn’t even get to teach/provide care Bc it’s not time or cost efficient.     MEDICINE is not ABOUT MONEY.  It’s about taking care of patients.  A mid level with two days training has no business taking care of patients independently-  a first year medical student is about as qualified.   That doesn’t inspire confidence, does it?    What can you do?  Always ask who is providing your care.  What are their credentials?  Is their supervising physician (if they have one) even on site for consultations??   Ask at every Clinic and Hospital you go to.  If they say no, ask to see a physician.  And if the answer is no, LEAVE.   And make sure you leave a review or comment to the facility as to why.    What can we doctors do? Refuse to participate in this sham that medicine has become.  Do not work for a company that requires you to blindly sign off on mid level charts for patients you’ve never met.  Yes, there will be consequences, until we stand together.
