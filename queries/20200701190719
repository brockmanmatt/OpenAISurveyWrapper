            "To all my female friends of \"age''... Most of us are going through the next stage of our lives. We are at that age where we see the wrinkles, gray hair, extra pounds. Menopause has already showed up or just waiting around the corner. We see the pretty 25-year olds and sigh. But, we were 25, too, just like they will one day be our age. What they bring to the table with their youth and zest for life, we bring with our wisdom, experience and good hearts. For all we've been through earning each gray hair... raising kids, bills and ills and whatever else life brought you/us over the 30s, 40\u2019s, 50\u2019s, 60's & 70s. We are survivors... We are warriors... We are women. Like a classic car or fine wine. While our exterior may not be what it once was, it is traded for our spirit, our courage and our strength to enter this chapter of our lives with grace and pride for all we've been through and accomplished.  Never feel bad about aging.  It is a privilege denied to many. Ladies, I challenge you to repost with your picture and age. \ud83d\udc96  Age: 52",

I wonder if those same people who elected Obama who are now labeled as racists are shooting themselves in the foot for the mistake of electing Obama and his \"fundamental transformation\".",
            "Weird to be back in AZ . To be with Mom, who is now a widow.  Sad that many years have passed and hadn't seen. My being gay caused the separation.  Ironically my niece is lesbian and they had assumed it.  My step father told my mom.  That he had lost a son, and was not going to lose grandchild.  Think of the years that were lost and now he's gone.  He adopted me and raised.  But once I was out.....",

            "I wrote something in a group recently that I feel needs to be shared...it is a response to Brock Turner and his desire to have his conviction thrown out.  I will post the whole thing, unedited.  Please read, and if possible, seek out the episode of which I speak.   One of the first encounters of I ever had with the frat boy rape culture, was in an episode of \"Quantum Leap\" entitled, appopriately enough, \"Raped.\"  For those of you that are unfamiliar with the show a scientist named Sam Beckett in the year 1999 invents a time machine whereby he can leap into the lives of other people. He uses this technology to help make the world better, one life at a time.  In the aforementioned episode, he wakes up to find himself in a hospital, his lip is split, his eye is blacked and he is being talked to very coldly, but very deliberately by a police officer. Sam had leapt into the body of a teenage girl named Katie, who was sitting in the hospital, following being raped by her date.  In the ensuing story, he goes after the smarmy son of a bitch who attacked this young lady. He faces the injustice of our legal system, the stares and snickers of a small town, an ADA with a painful secret and in a heartbreaking scene, an instance where the girl's very own father lashed out regarding the issue.  Sam handles it all with class and dignity, but a rage festers beneath the surface. The rapist was set free as it was determined that the sex was ultimately consensual but just...had \"gotten rough.\"  Sam and his guide were discussing things in the backyard of the young lady's home, when the rapist once again shows up. He admits to the audience finally that he did do it, but now he is a free man, because you cannot be charged for the same crime twice. They rapist even admits he couldn't believe that the jury bought the \"I take a girl out and now I'm on trial for rape\" bullshit statement. He ends this grotesque monologue by saying \"if you think the other day was bad, just wait until you see what happens this time.\" He takes steps toward Katie (who is still Sam remember) and unbeknownst to this slime ball, and ultimately incredibly satisfying, is that Sam holds several martial arts belts, and still retains his strength despite appearing as a woman. He proceeds to beat the holy hell out of this piece of garbage.  That episode stuck with me in a massive way. It is, to this day, an incredibly influential piece of art that has had a profound impact on how I view people like Brock Turner. It also has helped shape my entire personality regarding what I feel my duty is, not s a man but as a human fucking being.",
            "Yup. STILL typing...I am employed, and will get paid on the 18th, but it is only part-time, and I will run out before that date. I accept full responsibility for this. I have no excuse. I should know better, and will be more vigilant in the future. Also, (hopefully) my second job will begin the fourth week of this month, which will also help in the most immense of ways. Moving on...",

            "Lack of education ",
            "Congratulations everyone! The 2018 ACA (Affordable Care) enrollment period has been shortened from 90 days to 45 days (November 1-December 15, 2017) and the advertising budget to promote open enrollment has been slashed from $1M to $100k in an effort to sabotage the program. You're probably not seeing a lot of advertising (read: zero) about the enrollment window online or on TV. We are posting this and using the word congratulations so it gets posted more frequently in Newsfeed by FB algorithms. Please *copy and paste* (don't share) on your own timeline to help spread the word. Someone you know may desperately need health care. Please, everyone, also contact your congressional representatives and pressure, yes pressure, them to continue the State Child Health Insurance Program (S-CHIP). This program returns tax money to the states to provide health care for 9 million low-income children and 370,000 pregnant women in our country, including vaccines, dental care (for children only), well-child checkups, prenatal care, and disease/injury management. As of now, the program ended Sept. 30th. so most of these children are completely without health care. If you think you don't pay for their health care that way, think again. These children will show up in the emergency rooms and will be much sicker than they would have been if they had received early treatment, the hospitals will have to eat that cost, then raise the cost of health care for everyone to get their money back. Pregnant women will show up in labor, not having had prenatal care, and possibly give birth to children with multiple health problems that could have been averted beforehand. Children with birth defects and developmental delays will then require federally mandated early intervention services and special education, which taxes the resources in our already underfunded public schools. Children who are not healthy may not be able to participate in their educational opportunities and then do not grow up to be productive, healthy adults who contribute to society and support themselves. So yes, we do pay for them. Isn't it more moral and smart to pay for their healthcare and reduce the likelihood of these lifelong consequences? It is certainly cheaper.",
