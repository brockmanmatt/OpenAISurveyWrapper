            "Why is it that we keep having mass shooting after mass shooting in this country when we could\u2019ve easily done something right after Columbine in 1999?? Too many people are senselessly dying every year in this country due to gun violence. I\u2019m sorry, but the answer isn\u2019t more guns. That\u2019s not going to do anything. Its pretty bad when people from other countries who want to come to America and want to visit the country say they\u2019re actually scared to do it because they don\u2019t know what could happen to them. It seems like these mass shootings just get worse and worse too. So if it\u2019s not going to take what happened in Las Vegas to change the laws to make it tougher and to ban assault weapons, then what will? I get tired of seeing it every day. The rest of the world looks at us and can\u2019t understand why we can\u2019t change anything. It\u2019s so tiring saying these things after each mass shooting. When will Congress get the NRA out of it and start coming up with some form of comprehensive gun control? We have surgeon general warnings on cigarettes because we know they kill people but yet we just make it easy for someone mentally unstable to buy a weapon that\u2019s designed for war and can kill people too? Makes no sense at all to me.",

            "CRIMES OF THE PUTIN REGIME AGAINST HUMANITY  By sanders90  |  Posted January 26, 2015       The day of January 24 became the next rainy day in the modern Ukrainian history. The unprecedented cruel and brutal terror attack was committed in Mariupol. During the day the pro-Russian rebels fired at the densely populated uptown. As a result, 30 civilians have been killed, hundreds have been seriously wounded. The number of murdered civilians includes babies and women.   The rocket fire at residential districts of Mariupol by rebels has continued a series of bloody acts of terrorism, which include bombing of the regular bus near Volnovakha and cool-headed murder of civilians at a trolleybus stop in Donetsk, fire at residential districts of many towns and villages in Donbas.  The international coalition in support of Ukraine must provide the resolute rebuff to war crimes of rebels against humanity and strengthen all forms of pressure on those who generously sponsor and support them comprehensively.   Yesterday in houses and flats of all Ukrainian people from Kiev to Odessa, from Lvov to Donetsk, mourning candles were burning in memory of the civilian Ukrainian people who were lost as a result of terror attacks committed by the pro-Russian rebels. The memory of the innocent killed Ukrainians was also honored with national silence tribute.   According to the published spot report by the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission the attacks of Mariupol was launched from massed Multi-Launch Rocket System (MLRS) so-called Grad and Uragan, which, as we know, are delivered to rebels from the Russian Federation. The OSCE Report is noted that the Grad rockets originated from a north-easterly direction, in the area of Oktyabr (19 km north-east of Olimpiiska Street), and the Uragan rockets from an easterly direction, in the area of Zaichenko (15 km east of Olimpiiska Street), both controlled by the \u201cDonetsk People\u2019s Republic\u201d (\u201cDPR\u201d). In total more than one hundred rockets were launched to Mariupol from the side of Novoazovsk that is near border with the Russian Federation and was seized by the Russian troops last August.   What makes it especially brutal and cynic is that rebels of the terrorist organization \u201cDPR\u201d were well-aware that they fired at residential area of Mariupol with no Ukrainian troops in that. They knew that shells hit private buildings, cars, city market and the yards of high-rise buildings \u2026 Thus, the pro-Russian rebels used weapon against civilians of Mariupol. These criminal actions are qualified by international law as war crimes against humanity.   Intelligence service of Ukraine intercepted and published talk between rebels of \u201cDPR\u201d who planned to commit this bloody crime. In talk the 37-year-old rebel Sergey Ponomarenko known as \u201cTerrorist\u201d gave an order from Donetsk to use MLRS against civilian people of Mariupol. His accomplice \u201cAsh\u201d expressed readiness to execute the order to fire at the densely populated area of the city, and then reported on results. It\u2019s also the proof of the cynical and conscious crimes against humanity planned and committed by the pro-Russian rebels in the territory of Donetsk.   The Ukrainian authorities and all international community have already expressed condemnation of the attacks on Mariupol and accused the pro-Russian rebels of \u201cDPR\u201d. The Secretary of the National Security and Defense Council of Ukraine Oleksandr Turchynov imposed responsibility on the Russian President Vladimir Putin for death of civilians as a result of the attacks. \u201cBlood of people who were lost there, as well as many other Ukrainians, is directly on the President of the Russian Federation Mr. Putin, whose orders are executed by rebels. Therefore, responsibility will be inevitable and response of the Ukrainian armed forces and the National Guard to Russian invaders and rebels, who act under their control, will be also rather severe\u201d, Turchynov declared.  The reaction of the USA, EU, NATO and UN leaders was also very sharp.   The US Vice President Joe Biden promised strengthening the international pressure on Russia in phone conversation with the Ukrainian President Mr. Poroshenko.   It should be noted that on January 15 the EU Parliament approved the resolution on a situation in Ukraine, which, literally, says: \u201cIn case of any further actions of the Russian Federation destabilizing the situation in Ukraine, the EU Parliament calls the European Council to take further restrictive measures. So, that must be the expansion of the sanctions\u2019 application sphere on nuclear branch of industry and restriction of possibility of the Russian enterprises to perform the international financial operations\u201d.  Well, God is my witness, after these terrible events in Mariupol the international coalition must urgently make the decision on introduction of new severe economic sanctions against Russia. First of all, it\u2019s a shutoff of the International Payment System SWIFT in the Russian Federation. So, it\u2019s also the time to strike at last on Gazprom. Moreover, it's necessary to pass from sanctions to direct boycott of both Russian ideology and goods and services.   The comprehensive boycott is capable to cover not only political and economic, but also humanitarian, cultural and sports areas. There will be the real conditions for full international isolation of Russia.   It would be true to create the international tribunal for Russian war crimes in Ukraine. The principal task of such tribunal must be the investigations of war crimes against humanity committed by Russian troops and the terrorist organizations \u201cDPR\u201d and \u201cLPR\u201d in the territory of the East Ukraine.  It\u2019s necessary to deprive Russia of voice in both the UN and other international organizations, because it was alone that blocked the UN Security Council statement on censure of the attacks on Mariupol.   In the light of the latest tragic events related to massacre of civilian Ukrainians by the pro-Russian rebels, the international community needs to realize, at last, that the East Ukraine peace-making issues concern not only Ukraine, but also the whole Europe. In order to stop aggression of Putin who doesn't recognize the international codes and values, the international coalition must rally even stronger round the people of Ukraine to give the adequate response to the aggressor.",
