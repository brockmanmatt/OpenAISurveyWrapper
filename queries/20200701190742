            "SMILE OF THE DAY The High Price Of Silence  While her husband was busy at work one day, a bored housewife took a lover into her bedroom for some illicit fun, completely unaware that her nine year old son was silently hiding in the closet. And when her husband came home unexpectedly, she desperately hid her forbidden lover in the very same closet. The boy now had company, and broke the ice by whispering into the man\u2019s ear:  \u201cDark in here, isn\u2019t it, sir.\u201d Man: \u201cYes it is.\u201d Boy: \u201cI have a baseball.\u201d Man: \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d  Boy: \u201cWant to buy it?\u201d Man: \u201cNo, thanks.\u201d Boy: \u201cMy dad\u2019s right outside.\u201d Man: \u201cOK, how much?\u201d Boy: \u201c250 dollars.\u201d  After a few weeks, it happened again \u2013 the boy\u2019s father came home early, and the boy and the mom\u2019s lover ended up in the closet together.  Boy: \u201cDark in here.\u201d Man: \u201cYes, it is.\u201d Boy: \u201cI have a baseball glove.\u201d Man: \u201cThat\u2019s nice.\u201d Boy: \u201cWant to buy it?\u201d Man: \u201cI really don\u2019t.\u201d Boy: \u201cI\u2019ll tell.\u201d Man: \u201cHow much?\u201d Boy: \u201c750 dollars.\u201d Man: \u201cFine.\u201d  A few days later, the father said to his boy, \u201cGrab your glove. Let\u2019s go outside and toss the baseball!\u201d The boy said, \u201cI can\u2019t. I sold them.\u201d The father asked, \u201cHow much did you sell them for?\u201d The son said, \u201c1,000 dollars.\u201d The father said, \u201cThat\u2019s terrible to over-charge your friends like that. That is way more than those two things cost. I\u2019m going to take you to church and make you confess.\u201d  They went to church and the father alerted the priest, and made the little boy sit in the confession booth and closed the door. The boy said, \u201cDark in here.\u201d  The priest said, \u201cOh, don\u2019t start that again!\u201d",
