            "HIMNO DE ACCI\u00d3N DE GRACIAS Salmo 138     Te doy gracias, Yahveh, de todo coraz\u00f3n, pues t\u00fa has escuchado las palabras de mi boca. En presencia de Los Angeles canto Salmos para ti, hacia tu Santo Templo me arrodillo. Doy gracias a tu nombre por tu amor y tu verdad, pues la promesa ha superado tu credibilidad. El d\u00eda en que grite, t\u00fa me escuchaste, aumentaste la fuerza en mi alma. Te dan gracia, Yahveh, todos los reyes de la tierra, porque oyen las promesas de tu boca; !que grande la gloria de Yahveh! El alt\u00edsimo es Yahveh, y ve al humilde, al que se cree superior le conoce desde lejos. Si ando en medio de angustia, t\u00fa me das la vida, frente a la c\u00f3lera de mis enemigos, extiendes tu la mano y tu diestra me salva: Yahveh lo acabar\u00e1 todo por mi. Oh Yahveh, es eterno tu amor, no dejes la obra de tus manos.  GLORIA A TI SE\u00d1OR",
