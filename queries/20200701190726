            "On this day in '91, robbery parolee Rodney G. King stops his car after leading police on a nearly 8-mile pursuit through the streets of Los Angeles, California. The chase began after King, who was intoxicated, was caught speeding on a freeway by a California Highway Patrol cruiser but refused to pull over. Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) cruisers and a police helicopter joined the pursuit, and when King was finally stopped by Hansen Dam Park, several police cars descended on his white Hyundai.  The thereafter is now known as the 'Rod King Riots' or the '91 LA Riots'. ",

            "I's gonna be rich soon- this was in my Twitter DMs yesterday! It\u2019s my urgent need For a foreign partner that made me contact you in this media. I am Mr. mustafa karimi from United Arab Emirate Dubai working with Barclays Bank Plc U.A.E I'm writing to contact you over a very important Business Transaction which will be of our interest and benefit to our both families future.  In 2007,one Mr Husson Dunn, whose surname is same as yours and has your country in his file as his place of origin, made a fixed deposit for 36 months, valued at$26,700,000.00 with my bank. I was his account officer before i rose to the position of bank manager. The maturity date for this deposit contract was 27th of September 2010. Sadly Mr Husson Dunn,,, the death victims in the September 2009 earthquake in Indonesia that left over 1,200 people dead while he was there on business trip.   Since the last quarter of 2010 until today, the management of my bank has been finding means to reach him so as ascertain if he will roll over the deposit or have the contract sum withdrawn. When I discovered that this will happen, i have tried to think up a procedure to preserve this funds and use the proceeds for business. Some directors here have been trying to find out from me the information about this account and the owner, but I have kept it closed because i know that if they become aware that Mr Husson Dunn,,, is late, they will corner the funds for themselves.  Therefore, am seeking your co-operation to present you as the one to benefit from his fund at his death since you have the same name, so that my bank headquarters will pay the funds to you here from U.A.E. I have done enough inside bank arrangement and you only have to put in your details into the information network in the bank computers and reflect you as his next of kin. If you concur with this proposal, i intend for you to retain 50% of the funds while 50% shall be for me. Kindly forward your response to me.  Mr. Mustafa Karimi.

He bought a planter last Monday down by Loneoak and we needed a part for it.  We searchedc all over.  We even made a trip to Glenwood and searched the entire internet and couldn't find one so we gave up and decided to have one made.  But, Harry Wagner the machinest wasn't home so we headed back home.  Then like some miraculous occurance something crossed his mind.  He found a number and dialed the phone and asked about the part.  The man said let me check and call you back.  He called back and said he had one on the back of his truck.  We're going after it in the morning.  But the big question is how did Jimmy know to call him?",
