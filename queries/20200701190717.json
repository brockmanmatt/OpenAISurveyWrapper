While we are all sidetracked by Trump/Pence and the NFL, Trump vs. Puerto Rico, Harvey Weinstein & the Sexual Predation of All Hollywood, the Russian Hacking of the election, or the MLB American League Division Playoffs this week, the following bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives: 1. HR 861 to Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency 2. HR 610 - Vouchers for Public Education (which may end free public education as we know it) 3. HR 899 to Terminate the Department of Education (which may lead to greater disparity between states but nobody who uses public education ever moves so it's all good) 4. HR 69 to Repeal the Rule Protecting Wildlife 5. HR 370 to Repeal the Affordable Care Act 6. HR 354 to De-fund Planned Parenthood (exactly none of your tax dollars go toward abortion services) 7. HR 785 - National \"Right to Work\" (this one is actually a 'Right to fire you whenever your boss feels like it\" law, and it would effectively end unions) 8. HR 83 - Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill 9. HR 147 to Criminalize Abortion (\u201cPrenatal Nondiscrimination Act\u201d) (these private decisions should not be made by your legislator and employer) 10.

            "Went to bed about 8:30.  Dogs woke me up to go potty  about 1:30, and I heard that the message machine had the following info; this also on Marcus HS FB page:  MHS/Marcus 9 Notice | Feb. 15 Feb. 15, 2018 [9:45 p.m.]  Marcus families,  We apologize for the late notice, but we know emotions are running high for many students and parents after today\u2019s situation on campus. We know the rumor mill is in full effect tonight, so we want to take a minute to address what we know.   The Flower Mound Police Department has received calls regarding a rumor of a threat to campus. We are taking these threats seriously, although at this point we do not have any information we believe is a credible threat.   There will be an increased police presence on campus tomorrow to ensure the safety and security of our students and staff.  If your student has any credible information, please contact the Flower Mound Police Department at 972-539-0525.  We will continue to closely monitor the situation and will inform you of any further developments.  Gary Shafferman Principal Marcus High School  I don't want to be reactionary, but is there enough well-trained police presence that will be on campus today to avert any possible crisis? Ninety nine  percent certain a shooter/bomber isn't going to announce intentions in advance, but do I want to take that other 1 percent risk with my child's life?  I truly think there is far more risk when no announcement is made--didn't happen at any of the previous shootings.  BUT ... that 1 percent chance.  Not to mention the anxiety factor for students (plus teachers and staff):  How effective can they be with tests and other classwork with that threat looming?    If by chance my child goes to school today, I will be right there beside him.  All day.  We can't let panic rule our lives, but we must exercise common sense: What constitutes a \"credible threat?\"    Why wasn't school locked down yesterday, and why weren't parents of students at neighboring schools notified with an LISD-wide call, email and/or letter?  What type of threat did the FM police receive?  What will police presence at school entail?  Will there be enough police to thwart any possible attack?  Will backpacks/purses be checked, now and in the future?  I do think the school is doing the right thing when they announced about yesterday's situation that they would check  \"if disciplinary action was necessary\" with the boy who had a gun in his backpack.  I've always felt that the \"zero tolerance\" policy was so wrong:  students were \"convicted\" without an investigation of all circumstances.  I still remember a story from a few years ago when a boy in another state couldn't get his vehicle to start, didn't want to be late for school, so grabbed his dad's truck and got there on time.  Only to be arrested because his dad had a hunting rifle in the truck.  The boy was expelled, didn't graduate, and lost college scholarships.  A career needlessly lost, and a reputation marred because someone didn't take time for an objective investigation.  We have to keep some faith in life and humanity instead of feeding on fear.  Yet...there's that 1 percent:  We don't want our children massacred.   How do we ease our children's fears?  Better yet, how do parents and school administrators reach a rational decision?  We're in uncharted waters, and somewhere there is a solution.  Let's work together to find it.  Perhaps start by reinstituting the federal law dismantled last February.",
