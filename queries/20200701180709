            "So in the US under the Uniform Commercial Code (Article 2), the buyer has an insurable security interest in an animal not yet born when the animal is conceived.  So the law recognizes that the zygote of the animal is the animal (the product for which you are ultimately contracting) it will be when it is born.  But this doesn't apply to humans.  Because, obviously, the human zygote might spontaneously change species and become a puppy when it exits the birth canal. [insert eye roll here]  No need to comment, unless you can actually provide something new to the discussion, but nothing, to date, out of the pro-abortion positions has offered anything with any logic that comports with science.",
            "Congratulations! While we are all sidetracked by Trump/Pence and the NFL, Trump vs. Puerto Rico, Harvey Weinstein & the Sexual Predation of All Hollywood, the Russian Hacking of the election, or the MLB American League Division Playoffs this week, the following bills have been introduced in the House of Representatives: 1. HR 861 to Terminate the Environmental Protection Agency 2. HR 610 - Vouchers for Public Education (which may end free public education as we know it) 3. HR 899 to Terminate the Department of Education (which may lead to greater disparity between states but nobody who uses public education ever moves so it's all good) 4. HR 69 to Repeal the Rule Protecting Wildlife 5. HR 370 to Repeal the Affordable Care Act 6. HR 354 to De-fund Planned Parenthood (exactly none of your tax dollars go toward abortion services) 7. HR 785 - National \"Right to Work\" (this one is actually a 'Right to fire you whenever your boss feels like it\" law, and it would effectively end unions) 8. HR 83 - Mobilizing Against Sanctuary Cities Bill 9. HR 147 to Criminalize Abortion (\u201cPrenatal Nondiscrimination Act\u201d) (these private decisions should not be made by your legislator and employer) 10. HR 808 to Impose Sanctions Against Iran (even though they are in compliance with the agreement according to those in the know)  Please copy/paste and share widely!

            "Sad that a disastrous decision is being made because people are going with knee jerk opinions instead of facts.     Takes so little time to do valid research to find out that the majority of treatment is for routine and lifesaving care for women and children who have no other access to healthcare.   And the tiny percent of abortions, many because the fetus already is dead and/or the mother's life is in danger, are paid by the mother, NOT through federal aid.",

            "I know that some of my Christian and spiritual friends will probably disagree with me on this one. However, I am a supporter of women\u2019s reproductive rights. I have heard countless of stories from the women who have chosen to have abortions. I choose not to judge them because who am I to judge them? We are all imperfect. I remember the story of a family member who almost died having an abortion because it was illegal to have one in my native Dominican Republic. Women will choose to have abortions, no matter what you or I may believe, and I want them to have access to clean facilities with trained doctors... not to do it in the back alley and possibly die as a result. That\u2019s what almost happened to my relative in a country where abortion is illegal. I don\u2019t want that for my patients, for my family or for my friends.",

            "Copied from Dr Kathleen Ann\u2019s wall  Just in case it's not apparent to everyone - hormonal contraception has many indications that have NOTHING to do with preventing pregnancy. The group of white men are deciding to allow employers to decide to not offer insurance plans with coverage for medical treatment of REAL problems. Debilitating problems that make it difficult for some women to work and/or care for their families on a very regular basis. They can also be used to help bridge to menopause and avoid major surgery, but they would not know any of that since they did not invite ONE woman (or even an OBGYN) to sit in on the decision making. I'm sure those same plans cover Viagra\ud83d\ude21 Fuckers"
