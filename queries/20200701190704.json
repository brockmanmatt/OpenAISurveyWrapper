            "(Jon Gerberg /The Washington Post)  By Colbert I. King Opinion writer June 22 Email the author In all my years, I have never seen anything quite like this: a U.S. president who lies and demonizes at the drop of a hat. I don\u2019t just mean President Trump makes statements that tend to be inaccurate or misleading or that he exaggerates, equivocates and, at times, shades the truth.  No, this president repeatedly makes declarations that are flat-out at variance with established facts; assertions that on their face cannot be true.  As The Post\u2019s \u201cFact Checker\u201d column noted this week, until Wednesday, when Trump signed an executive order ending the separation of migrant families at the Mexican border, his \u201cadministration was insisting that it didn\u2019t have a policy of separating families (false), that several laws and court rulings were forcing these separations (false), that Democrats were to blame (false), that only Congress could stop family separations (false) and that an executive order wouldn\u2019t get the job done.\u201d  No other words for it: Trump is a baldfaced liar.  Speaking to reporters on Air Force One, Trump said April 5 that he was unaware of a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels ahead of the 2016 election.  From the White House transcript:   0:34 Trump says he didn\u2019t know about payment to Stormy Daniels President Trump on April 5 said he didn\u2019t know that his personal attorney paid adult-film star Stormy Daniels $130,000 days before the presidential election. (The Washington Post)  Q: Mr. President, did you know about the $130,000 payment to Stormy Daniels?  The President: No. No. What else?  Q: Then why did Michael Cohen make those if there was no truth to her allegations?  The President: Well, you\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen. Michael is my attorney. And you\u2019ll have to ask Michael Cohen.  Q: Do you know where he got the money to make that payment?  The President: No, I don\u2019t know. No.  A few weeks later, Trump lawyer Rudolph W. Giuliani revealed that the president reimbursed Cohen, his personal attorney, for the $130,000 he paid to Daniels. After Giuliani spilled the beans, Trump reversed his position, disclosing in a sequence of tweets that Cohen had in fact received a monthly retainer \u201cfrom which he entered into, through reimbursement, a . . . non-disclosure agreement\u201d with Daniels.  Then there\u2019s the Justice Department inspector general report on the investigation of Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails. Said Trump: \u201cI think that the report . . . totally exonerates me. There was no collusion, there was no obstruction.\u201d The truth? The report said no such things. As Justice officials told the Senate Judiciary Committee, the inspector general did not delve into questions of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia or whether he has obstructed justice in connection with special counsel Robert S. Mueller III\u2019s investigation. The report was about Clinton, not Trump.  The list of lies goes way back: Trump\u2019s \u201cbirther\u201d lie, that President Barack Obama was a foreign-born Muslim; Trump\u2019s charge that Obama had ordered wiretaps on the phones of Trump\u2019s transition team; his assertion that he saw Muslims in New Jersey celebrating 9/11.  The Post keeps track of Trump\u2019s falsehoods. As of May 31, the president had made 3,251 false or misleading claims since taking office. And there are no signs of him slowing down.  Trump\u2019s penchant for lying, which stems back to his days of moving and shaking as a real estate mogul, is separate and apart from his reported sliming of brown- and black-skinned people to inflame, demonize and dehumanize: \u201cShithole countries\u201d (Haiti, El Salvador, African nations); they \u201call have AIDS\u201d (Haiti); won\u2019t \u201cgo back to their huts\u201d (Nigerians); they \u201cinfest our country\u201d (immigrants).  \u201cWhy does he lie?\u201d is a question many have tackled. I don\u2019t know the answer. To accumulate and hold his grip on power? To bamboozle his supporters? To wiggle out of tight spots? The impact, nonetheless, is destructive. James P. Pfiffner, a public policy professor at George Mason University, wrote in a Brookings Institution blog that \u201cTrump\u2019s refusal to admit the truth of widely accepted facts corrodes political discourse and is consistent with the practice of many authoritarian leaders.\u201d Trump\u2019s narcissistic and demonstrably false statements about politics and policy, Pfiffner said, strike \u201cat the very heart of democracy.\u201d",

            "\"His standup, his shows Louie and Horace and Pete, and the projects he produces (Tig Notaro\u2019s One Mississippi) or helped create (Pamela Adlon\u2019s Better Things) all add to his public image as not just a funny guy, but a guy who gets it. Louis C.K. has never settled for just making jokes about other people; he has built a career on being a chronicler of his own privilege, his own comfort, his own excess, his own perversion and poor behavior. This self-awareness was comforting, for a while: He knows he\u2019s terrible, we thought, so he must somehow be one of the good ones.\"  It makes me especially angry when someone like Louis C.K. or Joss Whedon turns out to be a garbage person. They not only add to the torrent of rape culture, but they make it impossible for men (especially straight, cis-men) to serve as allies.   How can I or any other guy aid the gender equality movement when outspoken, prominent, progressive men routinely turn out this way? My word means nothing. Every single man's word means nothing. And that's the way it should be after what has happened.  Men have to hold themselves accountable. The culture of sexual assault and harassment and stands on a mountain of microaggressions. I don't like confrontation. In the past I've stood by as guys around me have said some pretty gross things. I didn't want the hassle. I didn't want to deal with the arguments. I and other men who want to be allies need to fight those battles. We can't afford to let sexism slide in the name of convenience. It's the only way things can improve.",
