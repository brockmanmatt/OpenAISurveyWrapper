For the non-firearms person who does not know a buttplate from a muzzle, these videos gave people a basic understanding of the parts of a firearm and what not to do when finding one.  By banning these videos, YouTube stimulates the \u201ccuriosity factor\u201d in people which will, without a doubt, increase the number of firearms mishaps resulting in needless deaths and injuries.  It appears to me that the people at YouTube are actually looking to promote increased tragedy involving firearms in order to further some ill-conceived agenda.",

            "This is so important because wether we die or the rapture comes. Do you have your heart right with God?   Here is what the bible says that will keep you from inheriting the Kingdom of Heaven.   Acts 2:38 \u2013 \u201cThen Peter said to them, \u201cRepent, and let everyone of you be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ for the remission of sins; and you shall receive the gift of the Holy Spirit.\u201d  Repentance is necessary for the remission of sins and to receive the gift of the Holy Spirit. The Bible speaks of many sins that must be repented of. We are going to quote the Scriptures that contain these sins and then look at each one individually.  Romans 1:28-32 \u2013 And even as they did not like to retain God in their knowledge, God gave them over to a debased mind, to do those things which are not fitting; being filled with all unrighteousness, sexual immorality, wickedness, covetousness, maliciousness; full of envy, murder, strife, deceit, evil-mindedness; they are whisperers, backbiters, haters of God, violent, proud, boasters, inventors of evil things, disobedient to parents, undiscerning, untrustworthy, unloving, unforgiving, unmerciful; who knowing the righteous judgment of God, that those who practice such things are deserving of death, not only the same but also approve of those practicing them.  Galatians 5:19-21 \u2013 Now the works of the flesh are evident which are: adultery, fornication, uncleanness, lewdness, idolatry, sorcery, hatred, contentions, jealousies, out bursts of wrath, selfish ambitions, dissentions, heresies, envy, murders, drunkenness, revelries, and the like; of which I tell you beforehand, just as I told you in time past, that those who practice such things will not inherit the Kingdom of God.  Colossians 3:5-10 \u2013 Therefore put to death your members which are on the earth; fornication, uncleanness, passion, evil desire, and covetousness; which is idolatry. Because of these things the wrath of God is coming upon the sons of disobedience, in which you yourselves once walked when you lived in them. But now you yourselves are to put off all these: anger, wrath, malice, blasphemy, filthy language out of your mouth. Do not lie to one another, since you have put off the old man with his deeds, and have put on the new man who is renewed in knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.  1 Corinthians 6:9-10 - Do you not know that the unrighteous will not inherit the Kingdom of God? Do not be deceived. Neither fornicators, nor idolaters, nor adulterers, nor homosexuals, nor sodomites, nor thieves, nor covetous, nor drunkards, nor revilers, nor extortioners will inherit the Kingdom of God.  Ephesians 4:31 \u2013 Let all bitterness, wrath, anger, clamor, and evil speaking be put away from you with all malice.  2 Timothy 3:1-5 - For men will be lovers of themselves, lovers of money, boasters, proud, blasphemers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, unloving, unforgiving, slanderers, without self-control, brutal, despisers of good, traitors, headstrong, haughty, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God, having a form of godliness but denying its power. And from such people turn away!"
