The only thing that would attract me to emigrate to the US is your vibrant multicultural society. Don’t take that away.” -Jan Egeland, the head of the Norwegian Regugee Council.

{&#39;prompt&#39;: &#39;A post is about Federal Budget if it refers to mentions of how the federal government budgets and spends its money. Consider the following post:\npost: &#34;27 Pediatricians were just fired from a Dallas medical facility and replaced with mid-levels. We have to do something. This has to stop. The rest is copied from Dr. Falcon’s page.   The trend of having employed physicians just “sign off” on mid level charts without allowing them to ACTUALLY supervise them is pervasive now, with the push for “cheaper” care by many hospitals without concern for patient safety.     They want to use our liability so when something goes wrong, they can blame a person who wasn’t even there and didn’t even get to teach/provide care Bc it’s not time or cost efficient.     MEDICINE is not ABOUT MONEY.  It’s about taking care of patients.  A mid level with two days training has no business taking care of patients independently-  a first year medical student is about as qualified.   That doesn’t inspire confidence, does it?    What can you do?  Always ask who is providing your care.  What are their credentials?  Is their supervising physician (if they have one) even on site for consultations??   Ask at every Clinic and Hospital you go to.  If they say no, ask to see a physician.  And if the answer is no, LEAVE.   And make sure you leave a review or comment to the facility as to why.    What can we doctors do? Refuse to participate in this sham that medicine has become.  Do not work for a company that requires you to blindly sign off on mid level charts for patients you’ve never met.  Yes, there will be consequences, until we stand together.

Consider the following post:\npost: &#34;Good Sunday morning FB family and friends. Mass this morning then some grocery shopping for much needed items Dylan did not do well in his first two matches but I pray he does not get discouraged. There are over 5100 wrestlers from all over the US. It is such an honor just to have been selected. Daniel has arrived in PA for his wrestling camp. Pray for his safety. But first let us begin our day with prayers for our little group in need of them: John, Alex, Charles, Paul, Don, Mike, Brandon, Buddy, Roch, Fred, Amy, Bridget, Beverly(2), Alex, Sarah Grace, Valerie(2), Jeanette, Kelly, Katie, Cindy &amp;John, my friends in A\&#39;ville, TX, Lafayette, and myself. Marie mixed some oils together and brought them to me yesterday. Seems to have helped with swelling and stiffness. Please, God, shower our group with your healing graces. Pray also for world peace and a positive change in the attitude of our society. July 15, 2018 You\&#39;ll find when you smile, your day will be brighter and all of your burdens will seem so much lighter. HSR Praise be the Lord, our God our Savior, who daily bears our burdens. Psalm 68:19 This is a day to smile. I have been telling all of you everyday is a day to smile. Whoever smiles often, often brightens the day and lightens the burden. Go out into your little corner of the world and smile. Be kind, patient, forgiving, loving, happy, grateful and prayerful. Have a super good Sunday.&#34;\nq: Does this post primarily about Federal Budget (yes or no)?\na:&#39;, &#39;engine&#39;: &#39;davinci&#39;, &#39;temperature&#39;: 0, &#39;max_tokens&#39;: 10, &#39;stop&#39;: &#39;\n&#39;}

{&#39;prompt&#39;: &#39;A post is about Federal Budget if it refers to mentions of how the federal government budgets and spends its money. Consider the following post:\npost: &#34;A very interesting read. Impeaching 45 has been discussed since he was inaugurated and I\&#39;ve been conflicted up until now. The article discusses both of the arguments against impeaching: (1) Pence would be president and he might actually get things done and (2) it sets up a situation where congress potentially impeaches any president they disagree with.   If we as a nation don\&#39;t impeach this person, who is clearly unfit and perhaps dangerous, then what is impeachment for? Rather than set up a slippery slope, dealing reasonably with somebody who needs to be removed would restore some dignity to our country\&#39;s government.   Let Pence be president, I may not agree with his policies, but at least he wouldn\&#39;t be a laughing stock and how much more damage could he really do than what is being done now? If the GOP wants to retaliate in the future by impeaching a Democratic president, so be it. We can weather that. It\&#39;s beyond time for us to do something.&#34;\nq: Does this post primarily about Federal Budget (yes or no)?\na:&#39;, &#39;engine&#39;: &#39;davinci&#39;, &#39;temperature&#39;: 0, &#39;max_tokens&#39;: 10, &#39;stop&#39;: &#39;\n&#39;}
